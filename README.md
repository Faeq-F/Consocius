## Consocius & Vivaldi
This used to be the repo containing the source code for Consocius; a minimal browser. I did move to using Vivaldi and no longer have a need to develop this project further; the source code will remain in the Consocius branch and this one will hold my custom css and js scripts for Vivaldi. This repository has been kept here to preserve it's history.

However, I no longer use Vivaldi either; please check my [ToolCustomizations repository](https://github.com/Faeq-F/ToolCustomizations) for my latest configs, etc.
